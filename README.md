# ðŸ’³ Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using **machine learning models**.  
Credit card fraud is a major concern in the financial industry, and this project demonstrates how ML techniques can be applied to identify suspicious activity in real-time.

## âœ¨ Features
- Handles **highly imbalanced datasets** using sampling techniques (SMOTE, undersampling).  
- Trains multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.).  
- Evaluates performance using metrics beyond accuracy (Precision, Recall, F1, AUC).  
- Visualizes fraud detection patterns with graphs.  
- Can be extended to real-time transaction monitoring.  

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset used is the **Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset**, which contains anonymized credit card transactions with a highly imbalanced class distribution.

- Total transactions: 284,807  
- Fraud cases: 492 (0.172% of total)
